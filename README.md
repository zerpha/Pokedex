# Pokedex
 Created a Pokedex database using binary search trees and hashtables.

## Instructions
 Create an empty C++ project. Add in all the header files to Header Files and put main.cpp into Resource Files.
 Add pokemon.txt in the file where the project is ran other wise the file will not read. 
 
## Running the Program
 When the program runs you will be introduced to a menu where you can input an option. The first option you can traverse either BST in preorder, postorder, or inorder. You can search for pokemon based on type or name in either the BSTs or the hashtable. You can insert and delete any pokemon. You can see the load factor of the hash function. There are also other options you can explore.
